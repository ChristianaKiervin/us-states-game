# us-states-game


Written as part of a challenge within 100 Days of Python udemy course with Dr. Angela Yu: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

Users can run file to launch Turtle GUI quiz app that takes guesses to all 50 states and adds correct guesses to corresponding coordinates on the map.

Uses Pandas to read a csv containing state name and x & y coordinates.

Players can stop the game by guessing "exit" and have a saved csv of all their missed guesses stored in the local project directory to learn from.
